# cv-challenge

To build and execute:

```sh
$ stack build
$ stack exec cv-challenge
```

This prints out all the "optimal" matching combinations of tutors and students.

I defined "optimal" that the count of possible matchings at one time to be the most.

In the given case, the maximum of the matching count is 5.

So this program will print out all possible 5 pairs.
